    "general_overview": "Bangladesh’s internet journey began in the early 1990s with limited dial-up email services via bulletin board systems. The first full internet service using a VSAT satellite link was launched in June 1996 [oai_citation_attribution:0‡bcs.org.bd](https://bcs.org.bd/en/blog/evolution-of-the-internet-in-bangladesh#:~:text=that%20year%20with%20offline%20emailing,technology%20to%20provide%20Internet%20service), when the government’s telecom authority (then BTTB) licensed the country’s first private Internet Service Providers (ISPs) [oai_citation_attribution:1‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Bangladesh#:~:text=In%20June%201996%20the%20first,2). In the late 1990s and early 2000s, internet access was mostly through slow dial-up connections; nevertheless, the ISP industry grew rapidly under liberalized policies, reaching over 180 registered ISPs by 2005 [oai_citation_attribution:2‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Bangladesh#:~:text=In%20June%201996%20the%20first,2). A major milestone came in May 2006 when Bangladesh connected to its first submarine fiber-optic cable, the SEA-ME-WE 4 consortium, via a landing station at Cox’s Bazar [oai_citation_attribution:3‡bcs.org.bd](https://bcs.org.bd/en/blog/evolution-of-the-internet-in-bangladesh#:~:text=Internet%2C%20all%20of%20a%20sudden,transmission%20speeds%20intended%20to%20accommodate). This significantly increased the country’s bandwidth and reduced dependence on costly satellite links. Mobile internet began around 2005 with GPRS/EDGE on 2G networks [oai_citation_attribution:4‡bcs.org.bd](https://bcs.org.bd/en/blog/evolution-of-the-internet-in-bangladesh#:~:text=the%20most%20remarkable%20years%20in,changer%20after%20Bangladesh%20got%20connected), but truly accelerated after 3G services launched in 2013 and 4G in 2018, bringing broadband to all 64 districts. As a result, internet usage soared: by March 2021 Bangladesh had about 116 million internet subscribers (roughly 70% of the population) [oai_citation_attribution:5‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Bangladesh#:~:text=The%20Internet%20in%20Bangladesh%20has,started%20the%204G%20network%20service).

Today, Bangladesh’s internet ecosystem is one of the largest among developing nations, supported by several submarine cables, nationwide fiber-optic networks, and a growing emphasis on digital services under the “Digital Bangladesh” initiative.",
